You can replace the ClientRegister.py with ClientRegistermodifed.py. Then run ClientMain.py and tracker.py to see the process of Registration.
However, it seems every time import ClientRegister.py in ClientMain.py, the userid initialized to "". The message sent to the traker message[4] is "" all the time. I think we should find a way to fix it.
